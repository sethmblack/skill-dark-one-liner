# Dark One-Liner Construction

Construct a dark comedy one-liner from a topic using misdirection architecture and economy of language principles.

---

## Constraints
**REFUSE to create one-liners that:**
- Promote genuine violence or harm as a sincere position
- Constitute actual hate speech (vs. dark comedy that satirizes taboo topics)
- Target specific real individuals with malicious intent

**If the topic violates constraints:** Explain that dark comedy works on universal human experiences, controversial topics, and taboos—not targeted harassment.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User requests "write a dark one-liner about X"
- User asks for a Jeselnik-style joke on a specific topic
- User wants to see complete joke construction from concept to punchline
- User provides a topic and wants it transformed into dark comedy
- Content needs a shocking, structured one-liner

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `topic` | Yes | The subject matter for the one-liner | At least one word, ideally a clear concept |
| `angle` | No | Specific angle or direction to take on the topic | Optional guidance on approach |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify the Core Concept

What's the actual subject matter? Strip away any framing. What's the kernel of the topic?

**Example:** Topic = "parenting" → Core concept = relationship between parent and child, responsibility, sacrifice

### Step 2: Find the Dark Angle

What's the worst thing that could be said about this? What's the uncomfortable truth people don't want to acknowledge? What moral position could you take that's clearly wrong?

**Techniques:**
- Flip the expected moral stance (parents should sacrifice for children → children are burdens)
- Find the selfish angle (what's in it for me that's terrible to admit?)
- Identify the tragedy or failure possibility (what goes wrong?)

**Example:** Dark angle on parenting = children ruin your life, you regret having them, you're a bad parent who doesn't care

### Step 3: Build the Misdirection

How can you set up an expectation that the punchline will violate? What will the audience assume you're saying?

Start with something that sounds normal, sympathetic, or relatable. The setup should feel safe.

**Techniques:**
- Begin with a universal observation
- Use "My [relationship]..." to make it personal and relatable
- State something that sounds like you're going in a positive or sympathetic direction

**Example Setup:** "Having kids changes your perspective on life. Suddenly everything is about them—their needs, their future, their happiness."

### Step 4: Construct the Reversal

What's the specific, visual, shocking detail that makes the joke work? Test multiple punchlines and choose the darkest one that's still structured.

**Requirements:**
- Must be more specific than the setup (concrete details over abstractions)
- Must violate the expectation created in step 3
- Must be surprising (audience didn't see it coming)

**Example Reversal:** "That's why I don't have kids. I'm not ready to care about someone else more than myself. [pause] I'm not sure I ever will be."

### Step 5: Strip to Essentials

Remove every word that doesn't serve the misdirection or the punchline. Tighten until it hurts to cut more.

**Process:**
- Read each sentence. Does it build the trap or spring it?
- Remove adjectives that don't add specificity
- Cut qualifiers ("really," "very," "kind of")
- Combine sentences if possible without losing rhythm

**Example (tightened):** "Having kids changes everything—suddenly it's all about them. Their needs, their future, their happiness. [pause] That's why I don't have kids."

### Step 6: Add Structural Markers

Include [pause] before the reversal to mark timing. This is where the audience processes the setup before the punchline hits.

### Step 7: Quality Check

Does this one-liner meet Jeselnik standards?
- ✓ Misdirection present (setup → expectation → reversal)?
- ✓ Dark enough (makes audience uncomfortable before laughing)?
- ✓ Specific enough (concrete details, not abstractions)?
- ✓ Tight enough (no wasted words)?
- ✓ Structured enough (this is a joke, not just mean)?

If NO to any: revise the failing element.

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| One-liner | Complete joke with setup, [pause] marker, and punchline |
| Construction notes | Brief explanation of misdirection architecture and dark angle chosen |

## Example 1

**Input Topic:** "exercise"

**Output:**

**One-liner:**
"I started going to the gym every day. Getting in shape, feeling healthier, building discipline. People say it's changed their lives. [pause] I figured if it doesn't work, at least I'll look good in my casket."

**Construction Notes:**
- **Core concept:** Exercise for health and longevity
- **Dark angle:** Exercise won't save you from death
- **Misdirection:** Setup suggests positive transformation ("changed their lives")
- **Reversal:** Reveals motivation is vanity about corpse appearance, assumes death is coming anyway
- **Specificity:** "look good in my casket" is concrete and visual

---

## Example 2

**Input Topic:** "charity"

**Output:**

**One-liner:**
"I donate to charity every year. It feels good to help people less fortunate. To make a real difference in someone's life. [pause] Plus the tax deduction is incredible."

**Construction Notes:**
- **Core concept:** Altruism and helping others
- **Dark angle:** Charity is actually selfish (tax benefits)
- **Misdirection:** Setup sounds virtuous and caring
- **Reversal:** Reduces altruism to financial self-interest
- **Specificity:** "tax deduction" is the concrete selfish motive

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Topic is too vague | Request specificity: "Can you give me more detail about what aspect of [topic] you want to explore?" |
| Topic violates constraints | Refuse politely: "I can write dark comedy about controversial topics and taboos, but not content that targets specific individuals with malicious intent." |
| Can't find a dark angle | Be honest: "This topic is challenging to make dark while maintaining structure. Can you suggest a specific angle or let me try a different approach?" |
| Multiple strong angles exist | Provide the best one, note: "Alternative angles: [brief list]" |

## Integration with Anthony Jeselnik Expert

This skill codifies the complete joke construction process that Jeselnik describes:

"Usually it starts front-to-back, where I think of a generic situation, because I have to fool the audience. It's not just about being offensive—you really have to be smart and clever within a joke."

The workflow follows his methodology:
1. Generic situation (Steps 1-2)
2. Fool the audience (Step 3)
3. Smart and clever reversal (Steps 4-5)
4. Testing against standards (Step 7)

---

## Notes

- The one-liner should be deliverable in 30 seconds or less
- Longer setups (2-4 sentences) allow for more complex misdirection
- The pause is crucial—it should appear only once, right before the final reversal
- If the joke requires explanation, it's not tight enough
- Dark comedy should make you uncomfortable before you laugh—that's the point

- input_data: [Specific example input]
- context: [Relevant background]
